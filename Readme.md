#Project-1: Holidays
Welcome to the Holidays app! This app helps travelers to plan their trips better by providing them with public holidays around the world. With this data, travelers can easily see what countries have holidays and long weekends in 2023.

To find holidays for a specific country, simply type the name of the country in the search form located at the homepage and click the search button. This will display two tables: one for the 2023 holidays for the country you searched and another for the long weekends.

Additionally, you can click the "More info" button to get basic information about the country. At the end of the page, you'll find the most popular holidays for Mexico, USA and Peru.

The app was built using HTML/CSS/JS and accesses data from either a public API. Communication between the client and API is handled asynchronously. The app runs on a single page with no redirects or reloads.

For interactivity, the app implements at least 3 distinct event listeners with their own unique callback functions. Array iteration is used with available array methods such as map, forEach, or filter. Good coding practices are followed, keeping the code DRY and utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.

##Requirements
* The app uses the API [Nager.Date](https://date.nager.at/). 
* The app uses the API [Rest Countries](https://restcountries.com/).
